# AI-Powered-Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

This project is a simple yet intelligent implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python. It features an AI agent powered by the Minimax algorithm, enabling the computer to make optimal decisions in every move. The game is designed for a single player (you) to compete against the AI, ensuring a challenging and strategic experience.

### Features:

- AI Opponent: The computer uses the Minimax algorithm to simulate an unbeatable AI player.

- User-Friendly Interface: A clean console-based interface for seamless gameplay.

- Dynamic Gameplay: Detects wins, draws, and invalid moves in real time.

- Simulated Thinking: Adds a brief pause for AI decision-making to enhance realism.

### How to Play:

- Run the Python script.

- Enter a number between 0-8 to place your mark (X) in the corresponding position on the 3x3 grid.

- The AI will respond with its move (O).

- The game ends when there’s a win or a draw, with results displayed on the board.

### Project Highlights:
 
- Utilizes Minimax algorithm for AI decision-making.

- Implements winning condition checks, board evaluation, and move validation.

- Simple and intuitive design to engage players while showcasing AI capabilities.
